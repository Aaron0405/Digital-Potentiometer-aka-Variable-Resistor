# Digital Potentiometer aka Variable Resistor
Digital version of a variable resistor - all controlled by an Arduino

If you ever wanted to adjust a circuit using a digital version of a potentiometer (variable resistor) controlled by an Arduino then this is the easy way to do it - and at a price that won't break the bank either.

Even better, it remembers the last setting if you switch it off, but do watch the video for some caveats of this feature.

It would be straightforward to use an infrared remote control to control the volume, for example, of an amplifier by using one of these devices.

There are only three control wires and of course the three wires that represent the variable resistor too.

In my GitHub there's a link to the PDF for this device (I'm using the 10K version - X9C103, but other values are available, see the video for more details).

Also, of course, there are the two demo sketches I use, simplicity itself and ones that a beginner could easily use.
